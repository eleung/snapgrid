**A [react-grid-layout](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout) v2 alternative, built on [dnd-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit).**

Draggable, resizable, responsive grid layouts for React, with pluggable packing and dragging tiles _between_ grids.

## Why snapgrid

- **Controlled & predictable**: you own the layout array; every change comes back through `onLayoutChange`. No hidden state.
- **Headless or drop-in**: `<GridLayout>` for the common case, or `SnapGridProvider` + hooks for full control of the markup. Ships **no CSS**.
- **Pluggable packing**: `vertical` / `horizontal` / `none`, plus `masonry` / `gravity` / `shelf` from `@snapgridjs/extras`, or your own `Compactor`.
- **Cross-grid dragging**: wrap grids in a `<SnapGridGroup>` and drag tiles between them.
- **Nested grids**: drop a grid inside a tile of another grid; each level keeps its own isolated drag session.
- **Responsive**: per-breakpoint layouts with `<ResponsiveGridLayout>`.
- **Resizable, with limits**: any edge/corner, per-item `minW/maxW/minH/maxH`, and `static` tiles.
- **Keyboard accessible**: every tile is keyboard-draggable — Enter/Space to pick up, arrow keys to move, Esc to cancel.
- **SSR-safe** and **TypeScript-first** (types included).

## snapgrid vs react-grid-layout

snapgrid keeps the parts of [react-grid-layout](https://github.com/react-grid-layout/react-grid-layout) people rely on — the `{ i, x, y, w, h }` layout model, controlled `onLayoutChange`, responsive breakpoints — and adds the things it can't do.

| | snapgrid | react-grid-layout |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Layout model (`{ i, x, y, w, h }`, controlled) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Responsive breakpoints | ✅ | ✅ |
| Resize handles · per-item min/max · static tiles | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Drag tiles _between_ grids** | ✅ built-in (`SnapGridGroup`) | ❌ |
| **Nested grids** | ✅ isolated per level | ⚠️ manual |
| **Keyboard dragging / a11y** | ✅ Enter · arrows · Esc | ❌ |
| **Headless** (bring your own markup) | ✅ provider + hooks | ❌ renders its own DOM |
| Pluggable packing | ✅ vertical / horizontal / none **+ masonry / gravity / shelf + custom** | vertical / horizontal / none |
| Accept external draggables | ✅ `dropConfig` / `onDrop` | ⚠️ `droppingItem` |
| Styling | unstyled, **ships no CSS** | requires `react-grid-layout.css` + `react-resizable.css` |
| Interaction engine | [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/), its latest framework-agnostic core (pointer · touch · keyboard) | react-draggable + react-resizable |
| TypeScript types | ✅ bundled | via `@types/react-grid-layout` |

> react-grid-layout is mature, widely deployed, and battle-tested. This table is about capability differences, not quality. snapgrid is new; if you need a proven incumbent today, RGL is a great choice. Coming from it? See the [migration guide](https://snapgrid.dev/docs/guides/migrating-from-rgl).

### Bundle size, honestly

<!-- Figures from apps/docs/components/generated/bundle-size.ts (run `pnpm --filter @snapgridjs/docs measure`). The docs site reads them live; this README mirror is updated by hand. -->

snapgrid itself is ~6 kB brotli, but it's built on [dnd-kit](https://dndkit.com/) (~27 kB), so a fresh install is **~33 kB brotli**, roughly **2× react-grid-layout v2's ~15 kB** (minified, React excluded). That weight _is_ dnd-kit, and it's a deliberate trade:

- **dnd-kit is the de-facto standard for drag-and-drop in React.** Its accessible, multi-sensor engine is what gives snapgrid keyboard dragging, touch support, and cross-grid out of the box (things RGL's older react-draggable/react-resizable stack doesn't).
- **If your app already uses dnd-kit, snapgrid adds only ~6 kB.**
- snapgrid tracks dnd-kit's **latest framework-agnostic line** (`@dnd-kit/react`), the line dnd-kit recommends over the legacy `@dnd-kit/core`.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @snapgridjs/react @dnd-kit/react @dnd-kit/dom
```

`@snapgridjs/extras` (masonry/gravity/shelf packers) is optional.

## Quick start

```tsx
import { GridLayout, useContainerWidth, type Layout } from "@snapgridjs/react";
import { useState } from "react";

export function Board() {
  const { width, containerRef } = useContainerWidth();
  const [layout, setLayout] = useState<Layout>([
    { i: "a", x: 0, y: 0, w: 4, h: 2 },
    { i: "b", x: 4, y: 0, w: 4, h: 2 },
    { i: "c", x: 8, y: 0, w: 4, h: 2 },
  ]);

  return (
    <div ref={containerRef}>
      <GridLayout layout={layout} width={width} onLayoutChange={setLayout}>
        {layout.map((item) => (
          <div key={item.i} className="tile">{item.i}</div>
        ))}
      </GridLayout>
    </div>
  );
}
```
